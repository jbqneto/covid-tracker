# COVID Tracker

Simple app showing world´s latest confirmed COVID cases, updated on a github repository that contains (or should) this information. The project real purpouse was for me to practice some Java with Spring and Thymeleaf.

Although i´ve followed an *youtube tutorial* there are some differences on my code. I use *JAVA 8* instead of *JAVA 12* used on the tutorial, and also i had to import the *HttpClient* lib in my *pom.xml*, as you can see on the external links i´ve quote on the external links.

* The original package name 'io.jbqneto.covid-tracker' is invalid and this project uses 'io.jbqneto.covidtracker' instead.
